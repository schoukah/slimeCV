# Supplies needed for *Physarum* (a.k.a slime mold) cultivation

-   Ethanol for cleaning working surfaces and sanitizing instruments
-   Tweezers or surgical tongs (either plastic or stainless steel works fine)
-   Plastic containers or petri dish plates (all sorts can be fine)
-   A bigger cardboard box or square canvas bag to keep *Physarum* in the dark.
-   White paper towels
-   Oat flakes (for feeding. [This page says to not choose instant, not sure why though](http://www.buildingthepride.com/faculty/pgdavison/PHYSARUM%20culture%20for%20web.html)).
-   A dry, dark cupboard or closet to store *Physarum* cultures.
-   A phone or camera (to take pictures)
-   A computer file or small notebook for documentation and lab note-taking.
    
    For agar:

-   Powdered agar-agar: convenience store agar powder works fine (agar flakes take longer and are not necessary).
-   Distilled water
-   A measuring cup
-   a small, precision milligram scale
-   Big 750ml mason jar (if microwaving)
-   Baking gloves for handling hot liquids
-   IR thermometer (facultative).
-   Plastic wrap (facultative. Only needed if making extra plates that will be stored in the fridge)
